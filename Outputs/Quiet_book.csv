5,Amazing book!,"This is one of the best books that I've read, and hats off to Susan Cain for this amazing work. The book talks talks about introversion in detail and the various behaviors and tendencies of introverts and what they seek. Susan, herself an introvert, is able to easily put the reader at ease, especially an introverted one. Quiet talks about the role an introvert can play in a world that is increasingly tending to overvalue to extroverted ideals, and this is why the book is extremely relevant. E..."
5,I appreciate silence!,"I loved this book! It's all about introverts in a culture that celebrates extroversion. We have a personality worshiping culture and the new social media has only made it worse. Everyone on Facebook is a performer. Despite 1/3 to 1/2 of the population being introverts, everything in our culture from parenting to school to work to socializing celebrates and rewards extroversion. Some of the most creative and brilliant creators and thinkers in history were introverts. The theme of this work is ..."
3,Quietly making Noise!,"This book found its way to my library through a chance introduction to this book in the authors' TED talk.It suits my temperament to read/write than to speak and this book attempts to explain why is this so.  This the author does it with relevant research studies and examples and is impressive for comprehensiveness if not for thoroughness (of course, one would not expect this in this genre - popularization).It is a great read to all introverts and extroverts.  One thing I noticed was that..."
5,Masterpiece on this subject: Kudos to the author,First of all I would like to salute the author for the kind of research she has done to come up with such a masterpiece. Not only she has provided enough research references to make her point but at the same time she has taken care that the message is being delivered to the readers without writing anything wrong about being extroverts/introverts.. She has handled the subject very beautifully and has explained both temperaments the best way..One thing I want to clarify is that the book is no...
5,reader's review,"this book is no novel let me tell you or is it really engrossing, but as you read you will understand what and how to understand if you are an introvert!if you are an introvert, you are in for surprise, this book has enough point to tingle your senses, you will be at joy reading some pages. beautifully written book :)"
5,Quiet: A Revelation,"The book is a boon to the introverts and extroverts alike, and you can gift it to either or both. For the former to gain confidence, and for the latter to understand the former. The interesting insights backed by solid research are the takeaway lessons one can use in life. Most important lesson I feel is that persistence, concentration, and self-control can be put to good use by the introverts. Then they can act extrovert if they choose, without loss of identity or individuality provided the..."
4,Nice read and really enjoyed understanding myself better,"Despite being an author from foreign the language used was not complex and jargon free. The concepts and points put forward in simple manner. This will really help an introvert understand himself better and also appreciate his / her own strength. I would not only recommend this to be read by introvert but also by the other personality trait person i.e. Extrovert. I really like the various examples provided to support the ideas e.g. Impact of Open office concept, Mr. Little experiment, and als..."
5,A book which makes introverts feel less alone...,"QUIET is a must read for anyone who wonders why the world doesn't listen to them, though what they say generally ends up being right!Introverts are more conflicted than extroverts; the former feeling many a times that something is fundamentally wrong with their attitude. QUIET helps introverts understand they are not alone; in fact, if anything, they are more gifted at solving problems and being creative. She goes on to point out how many famous & successful personalities (Steve Wozniak, Gu..."
5,Best in the market!,Quiet has really been an eye opener for me. I have never felt so proud of being an introvert until I read this book. It's truly been a great read.
5,Amazing book!!!!,Excellent work by Susan Cain.This book very well explains that introverts are no less than extroverts.The author has proved each and every quality of introverts by taking suitable examples.
4,Recommended but font size could be bigger.,This is a great book not only Quiet nature people but for all...One star less to publisher for tiny fonts. Or I was wondering if Auther asked for small fonts to focus more on contents!!Overall very good book. Flupkart delivery was on time.
4,"A must for every introvert, a special recommendation to fake extroverts","Hey! are u an introvert struggling to fit in this highly extrovertness demanding society?Don't worry, firstly the some of the extroverts around you may actually be introverts as one out every three persons is an introvert.This book provides a confidence boost to people like me out there.It will surely make you appreciate yourself the way you are.And if you can appreciate yourself only then can you expect it from others.So definitely, this is a must read for all the high-reactives(P.S. rea..."
5,I Love Susan Cain,"Now unfortunately Susan is quite elder to me (merely 27 years old) and happily married. Psst! BANG! I love her because I am a 19 year old and she has helped me to realize who I am, just like millions of us, the introverts.Okay, now for the sake of being unbiased as this is a review, let's talk business. Quiet is a non-fiction book focusing on how the mankind inadvertently (or maybe advertently) discriminates the introverts. Susan has carefully researched introversion and extroversion, touri..."
5,Give insight of yourself!,"Written in perfect way. Examples which have been included are perfectly resemble with the topic.Some of you will start looking at people with new eyes, if you thoroughly understand the book. Do not expect so much interesting, but nicely written so you will not be bored.And obviously get it at your doorstep with flipkart delivery( discount is certain:P)."
5,Excellent Read,"It helped me understand I am an ambivert. I admit I too was biased in favour of extroverts but after reading this book, I respect introverts and extroverts alike, amusingly the balance now mildly shifted towards introverts :-) Yes, this is what this book can do to you- change the way you think :-)"
4,A great book for introverts,"There are not many books that shine the light upon the hidden world of introverts. You might have read stories or met people who are introverted but not many people have appreciated them outright. Susan Cain's book is such a book. Even if you are extrovert, you would know many introverts and this book would help you appreciate their nature and understand it well. Just for reference, before buying this book, people can see her TED talk on this to get the gist. Overall, it is a great book."
4,Helps to realize the power of being Quiet!,"On reading this book I did not find whether it favors Introverts or criticizes the Extroverts. It basically talks about the strength of the quite character which is generally misunderstood or side lined by the dominant extrovert characters in the society. Through various examples, especially the first one, it compels the reader to understand the power of the quite person through few but very strong words of expression. For me this book is more accurate one to use my quietness in a more approp..."
5,Deserves to be widely read !!!,"Well researched and lucidly written,this book might be the best book ever written on the concept of Introversion.It helps us understand ourselves and the people in our life much better.Filled with wonderful insights,it reassures introverts about their beliefs and behavioral patterns and acts as an eyeopener for the less observant class of the society.The book also offers some valuable advice whenever needed.Despite being on a serious topic,the book is an absolute page-turner and will be a che..."
5,One of the best in ma collection,This book is so interesting that I completed it in just 2 days....A perfect buk 4 nd about introverts...I can say tis s one of the best in ma collection...;)
5,This is therapy for introverts. Highly recommended.,"This is therapy. This is a celebration of introvertism. This is all those things that you feel and know inside your head as an introvert put into an appreciative context.It's apparent that a lot of research has gone into this, and Susan has dug deep to find relevant studies in the field. There's a healthy sprinkling of anecdotes as well, which I think would resonate with every introvert who's reading this.The comparison between the Western focus on the individual, and the Eastern focus on..."
5,Brilliant book...insightful...well researched...with strategies!,to start with...delivery experience was outstanding.The book itself takes a very novel approach. Most books on introvert-extroverts...look at personality characteristics and their manifestations...and somehow the agenda is to fix one of the two. Usually introversion is treated as a disease and extroversion as 'healthy' personality.Susan starts with countering these presumptions....and takes a different tack by going deep to understand what is happening in the minds and why. Instead of clump...
5,Transforms Introverts,"There is nothing wrong being quiet,shy or introverted.But there are distinctive advantages to being this way and the book affirms this.The best part of ""Quiet"" is that the insights drew from the studies can help introverts take advantage of their special traits and thrive on their own terms in an extroverted world"
4,A Precious Gem,"The book had such an aesthetic appeal the moment I looked at the cover and it never disappointed. Thoroughly researched and succinctly put , the attitudes and behaviours of introverts vis-a-vis extroverts in a world that prefers personality over character is so nicely woven in words with beautiful anecdotes.It helps you explore yourself with much more clarity regarding why we do something that we do.Hugely enriching and educating. Recommended for people either of the -verts to know each oth..."
5,A must-read for all,"This is the best non-fiction book i have ever read, and i have read many. there are many books that provide an insight into human behavior, and even though some are really good, this one tops any list. a result of 7 years of dedicated efforts to research upon the subject, susan has done an amazing job with this book. it is sure to enlighten the perspective of every reader and make a huge impact upon the reader's behavior and understanding of people. it helps greatly if every person in a famil..."
5,Quiet : The Soft Power #Sovereign,"Quiet, is a book which one can't afford NOT to Read.. Undoubtedly I can say that, the one who has read this beautifully written book, must have got enlightened by the glory of being Quiet. The theme of this book is the great example of Quiet Strength that Introverts are bestowed with.. So, here's the clear example of the lines said by Mahatma Gandhi- ""In a gentle way you can shake the world""."
5,An Insightful and Recommended Read,"This is no ordinary book and definitely not a self-help book. Susan's insights are heart-felt but they are presented in a beautifully non-judgmental, crisp way along with a lot of research and details thrown in. It definitely challenges a supposedly common theme of the quiet one being overlooked in a world increasingly focusing on loudness with some fresh perspective. Highly recommended :)"
5,Paradigm changing book,"This is  a great book , this book along with  7 Habits of highly effective people helped me a great deal. Like The 7 Habits of highly ... this book emphasizes character ethic over adaptation of personality .I have read only first half of the book still this book changed the way I looked at the world . In today's world extroverts may appear to be highly successful but introverts should continue being themselves .Instead of adopting traits of extroverted people introverts should discover their..."
5,A Wonderful Gift for Introverts,"This book will surely raise the morale of introverts who are struggling to find their place in an overly extroverted world.  I, being an almost hundred percent introvert, found it very encouraging. Most of the time  introverts struggle against their own personality in order to become more extroverted, or at least act more extroverted. What they do not realize is that they are struggling against their own natural self and trying very hard to become something they are not. Nor do they realize t..."
5,A wonderful book in the Lowest quality paper and the Smallest font available,"For the book: 5/5For the book quality: 1.5/5It took around 7 years for the author to write this wonderful book and it would take just glance for you to hate it. Not because of what it's written inside, it because of its worst quality paper and small fonts.At first Publisher,Penguin India, charging 320 rupees may make you think that it quite less what earlier publisher,Crown Publishing Group, used to charge, but believe me, as soon as you'll get this book in your hand you'll get to know w..."
3,Fair,paper quality is a bit poor
5,An excellent book,I haven't read a better book in 2015. Quiet explores the humane minds of introvert people. If your'e an introvert you'll understand the numerous difficulties you've faced so far in life and learn how to overcome them in the future and if you're an extrovert you'll see introverts in a new light of empathy.
4,A Must Read !!,As a non-fiction reader I can tell you that this book is just awesome. As of introverts or the people who are sad or confused about being an introvert should read this book. There are huge number of experiments or social experiments and logical explanations which actually make the book really special.
5,Most significant book on Personality,"This book will talk to you while you are reading it. You will have moments when you will say ""Hey, yes that is me"" (especially introverts). If you give this book a miss, you will give one of the best reading experiences a miss."
5,Cool,"Interesting Book , this book is also so light . in this price simply i can say it is amazing so if you want to read go for it ."
5,Awesome book,"I bought this book after seeing Susan Cain in the TED videoThis is a fabulous book. I've recently come to the idea that people also fall into two energy types: mental and physical. Those of us who like to sit and think end up being called ""lazy."" People who have lots of physical energy are ""hyperactive"" and forced to take medication. Imagine what might happen if these differences were also embraced"
5,the best book to understand INTROVERSION !!!,QUIET is an amazing book...thoroughly researched..it will make us perceive people differently..it has something to offer to each strata of our society...every person can find himself and his friends in this book...amazing book !!!

5,Best in the market!,Indespensable for introverts.
5,A book worth reading!,"i've been reading this book since last week and it has revealed a lot about me ,which even i was unaware of. Truly a masterpiece by Susan Cain and one of the best books for introverts."
5,awesome,"Thank you, Susan Cain, for writing this remarkable book!.Ms. Cain clearly demonstrates the importance of both personality types and the value of introversion."
5,excellent book,Susan Cain has really taken up good examples and given the reader a deep insight of the thinking of introverts and extroverts. A must read i would say.
5,Awesome insights.,"After reading the title it looked that whatever I have been doing unknowingly all these years actually had a meaning. I was so full of confidence after finishing the same. I have not read any other title on the personality types subject, and now I feel that I actually don't have to. Thanks Susan."
5,Quiet,Thoroughly enjoyed reading it. A must read for all introverts as well as extroverts. Found it very useful in understanding introvert behavior.
5,proud to be an introvert after read this book,i read this book its very interesting about introverts its re defining the meaning of introverts actually i am an introvert so i enjoyed while reading it congrats to susan cain for your 8 year research recgnozid by the world.
3,Nice Subject but boring some times,The font is too small. Too much content. Could have been easy if it was wrapped up in 150 pages. English is ok but could have been simpler for beginners.
5,Must Have,A definite read for the introverts which will make them believe and also to extroverts that they should not underestimate the power of Silent folks
4,Quiet,"Tagline says it all!A must read for all the introverts who want to accept themselves in this changing world where extroversion is celebrated. I personally feel, it's not meant for only introverts, even extroverts need to know about and show respect (give space!) to introversion. In that case, here is the right portal."
5,Quiet,Simply Outstanding book. You don't have to be an introvert to read this book. It gives you a better understanding of yourself and other people.
5,Must Read,This book is value for money. it is a must read and can be re-read. The book is written in such a manner that you feel the author is sitting next to you and giving practical advise. The second half of the book is more captivating.
5,U can see urself,"This is not a book rather a mirror where u can identify self.Once u know the patterns, it becomes easy to plan ur moves."
5,good book to understand types of people,"books is  with regards to the Personality psychology, author is a best narrator,             the first chapters on extroverts is good , could relate it ... no complex concepts and a good read"
5,A must book who want to look themselves in a new way especially when you are an introvert,I read the whole book and i love the concept of introversion. I am an introvert and i see myself in a whole new complete way. :)
5,An eye-opener,"A introvert myself I always thought something was wrong with me - I couldn't quite fit in with the group. But thanks to this book, now I know I am just an introvert, one of many who go about their lives quietly. Showed me my strengths, and to make the best of them. Must read for introverts, I am glad I read it!"
4,the world of introverts,"An excellent book in understanding and coping up with the world of introverts in personality driven extrovert era. the book is of course a non fiction book on psychology susan cain a  honours graduate from pinceton and harvard school of law shares her sights, breakthroughs and breakdowns.."
5,"very well researched, thoughtful and unbiased masterpiece...","Changing circumstances and demands of the society tends to give more value to extrovert. Society biased-ness towards extrovert is a psychic pain for introverts, so most of the introverts try to become extrovert, here they lose power of their own being. Cain argues introvert too have a very special role in the society. Perhaps she make you understood that being a introvert is gift. I strongly recommend this book to every individual. Extrovert can also read this book to understand how to deal..."
